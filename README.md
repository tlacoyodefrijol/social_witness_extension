# Social Witness

The Social Witness figure is a mechanism of citizen participation to involve civil society in relevant procurement processes due to their complexity, impact or amount of resources requiring special attention to minimize risks of opacity and corruption. 

This figure exists only in Mexico. There is a committee of Social Witnesses [here](http://www.testigossociales.org.mx/TestigosSociales/)
