# Social Witness

The Social Witness figure is a mechanism of citizen participation to involve civil society in relevant procurement processes due to their complexity, impact or amount of resources requiring special attention to minimize risks of opacity and corruption. 

This figure exists only in the procurement processes in Mexico. There is a committee of Social Witnesses [registered in the Funcion PÃºblica ministry](http://www.funcionpublica.gob.mx/unaopspf/tsocial/tsocial.htm) and it can be an individual or an entity. The federal government has social witness as compulsory and subnational governments can opt in.
